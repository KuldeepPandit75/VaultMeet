# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive responsive design across the entire website to ensure optimal user experience on all device types and screen sizes. The responsive design will adapt layouts, components, and interactions to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices while maintaining functionality and visual appeal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the website on any device, I want the interface to automatically adapt to my screen size, so that I can have an optimal viewing and interaction experience regardless of whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the website on a desktop (â‰¥1024px width) THEN the system SHALL display the full desktop layout with all navigation elements, sidebars, and content areas visible
2. WHEN a user accesses the website on a tablet (768px-1023px width) THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to a tablet-optimized view with collapsible navigation and adjusted content spacing
3. WHEN a user accesses the website on a mobile device (<768px width) THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-first layout with hamburger navigation, stacked content, and touch-optimized interactions
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the layout to accommodate the new dimensions
5. WHEN content overflows on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate scrolling, wrapping, or truncation strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want all interactive elements to be easily tappable and navigable, so that I can use all website features effectively on my touch device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with buttons, links, or form elements on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum touch target sizes of 44px x 44px
2. WHEN a user navigates through the interface on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for touch interactions
3. WHEN a user accesses dropdown menus or modals on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt them to mobile-friendly patterns (full-screen overlays, bottom sheets, etc.)
4. WHEN a user performs gestures like swipe or pinch THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately where applicable
5. WHEN a user focuses on form inputs on mobile THEN the system SHALL prevent viewport zooming and ensure proper keyboard handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want images, videos, and other media to scale appropriately to my screen size, so that content remains visible and doesn't break the layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed on any screen size THEN the system SHALL scale them proportionally to fit within their containers
2. WHEN videos are embedded THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratios and provide responsive video players
3. WHEN tables or data grids are displayed on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL implement horizontal scrolling or alternative mobile-friendly representations
4. WHEN charts or graphs are shown THEN the system SHALL adapt their size and potentially simplify their display for mobile viewing
5. WHEN media content loads THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts by reserving appropriate space

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want a consistent responsive design system, so that new features automatically inherit responsive behavior and the codebase remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new components are developed THEN the system SHALL use standardized breakpoints and responsive utilities
2. WHEN CSS is written THEN the system SHALL follow mobile-first responsive design principles
3. WHEN layouts are created THEN the system SHALL use flexible grid systems and container queries where appropriate
4. WHEN typography is implemented THEN the system SHALL use responsive font sizing and line heights
5. WHEN spacing and sizing are defined THEN the system SHALL use relative units and responsive spacing scales

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with varying internet connection speeds, I want the responsive design to consider performance, so that the website loads quickly and efficiently on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served to different devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriately sized images for each screen resolution
2. WHEN CSS and JavaScript are loaded THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle sizes and eliminate unused responsive code
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL prioritize above-the-fold content and defer non-critical responsive elements
4. WHEN animations or transitions are applied THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. WHEN responsive layouts are calculated THEN the system SHALL minimize layout recalculations and reflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the responsive design to maintain accessibility standards across all device sizes, so that I can use assistive technologies effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layout changes for different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper heading hierarchy and semantic structure
2. WHEN navigation is collapsed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
3. WHEN content is hidden or shown responsively THEN the system SHALL properly communicate state changes to assistive technologies
4. WHEN focus management is required THEN the system SHALL maintain logical tab order across all responsive layouts
5. WHEN color contrast is applied THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG guidelines across all device types and screen conditions
