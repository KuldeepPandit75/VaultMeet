# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical room synchronization issue where users joining rooms are not visible to existing participants, resulting in users appearing to be in empty rooms despite being in the same room as others. This is a real-time multiplayer synchronization problem that affects the core functionality of the VaultMeet platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Room State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user joining a room, I want to be immediately visible to all existing participants in the room, so that I can interact with them in the virtual space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully joins a room THEN all existing participants SHALL receive a real-time notification of the new user's presence
2. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the new user SHALL receive the current state of all existing participants in the room
3. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the user's avatar SHALL appear in the correct position for all participants within 2 seconds
4. IF a user's join event fails THEN the system SHALL retry the synchronization automatically up to 3 times
5. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the room's player count SHALL be updated consistently across all clients

### Requirement 2: Robust Socket Connection Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, reliable socket connection system for room management, so that there are no race conditions or synchronization conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to a room THEN only one socket connection SHALL be used for all room-related events
2. WHEN socket events are emitted THEN they SHALL be processed in the correct order without race conditions
3. IF a socket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resynchronize room state
4. WHEN a user joins a room THEN all socket event listeners SHALL be properly established before emitting join events
5. WHEN multiple users join simultaneously THEN each join event SHALL be processed atomically without conflicts

### Requirement 3: Consistent Room State Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want room state to be managed consistently across all services, so that there are no discrepancies between different tracking systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN room state changes THEN all tracking systems (roomPlayers, roomGameSpaces, playerRoomGameSpaces) SHALL be updated atomically
2. WHEN a user leaves a room THEN all references to that user SHALL be cleaned up from all tracking systems
3. IF room state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect and automatically correct the inconsistency
4. WHEN room state is queried THEN all tracking systems SHALL return consistent information
5. WHEN room cleanup occurs THEN empty rooms SHALL be properly removed from all tracking systems

### Requirement 4: Proper Event Sequencing and Timing

**User Story:** As a user, I want room joining to work reliably regardless of network conditions or timing, so that I never experience the "empty room" issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the game scene SHALL wait for socket connection confirmation before initializing
2. WHEN socket events are set up THEN they SHALL be established before any room join events are emitted
3. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the sequence SHALL be: connect → authenticate → join room → sync state → notify others
4. IF any step in the joining sequence fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback and retry options
5. WHEN the room joining process completes THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation that they are visible to others

### Requirement 5: Real-time State Validation and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect and fix synchronization issues automatically, so that I don't have to manually refresh or rejoin rooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has been in a room for 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL validate that they are visible to other participants
2. IF a synchronization issue is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to resynchronize the user's state
3. WHEN state validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a "Resync" button to manually trigger synchronization
4. WHEN resynchronization occurs THEN it SHALL not disrupt the experience of other users in the room
5. IF automatic recovery fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging and error handling for room synchronization, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN room synchronization events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps, user IDs, and room IDs
2. WHEN synchronization errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context including socket states and room states
3. WHEN a user reports synchronization issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to help troubleshoot
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient detail to reproduce and fix the issue
5. WHEN synchronization metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be available for monitoring and alerting
